# MAC-unit-MUTIPLY-ACCUMALATE-UNIT
FPGA-based matrix multiplication accelerator implemented in Verilog HDL.  The design uses a pipelined MAC architecture with synchronous dual-port RAM,  explicit valid control, and cycle-accurate dataflow. Verified using a  self-checking testbench and designed to be timing-clean under STA.
